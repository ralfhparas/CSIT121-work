            <p>
                
                I learned a lot from these first two labs as they helped me understand a lot of things. One of the things I learned was the different meanings
                of tags and how to use them properly. I also learned how to properly structure a webpage using HTML and without the tags it
                cant be made. I also learned hot to use VS code and how to use it make a webpage. I also learned how to use github
                and upload my files to it. Manuerving through github was a bit confusing at first but after a while I got the hang of it. 
                Overall I learned a lot from these two Labs and ready to learn more in the upcoming Labs

                I also learned hot to use VS code and how to use it make a webpage. It also helps me stay organized with my files
                and makes it easier to edit my code. The preview feature also helps me see what my code looks like in real time which
                helps a lot. Learning all those also helped me structure my code in VS code better.

                I also learned how to use github
                and upload my files to it. Manuerving through github was a bit confusing at first but after a while I got the hang of it. 
                I also learned how to make the respositories public and upload my files to it. I also learned how to make a readme file
                and edit it.

            <p> Using some of the apps and manuvering through them were a bit confusing and challenging at first but im starting
                to get the hang of it now and still learning some things as I go along. Some of the tags as well we're kinf of confusing
                but I after reading through some articles and watching some videos I was able to understand them better. Overall I learned 
                a lot from these two Labs and ready to learn more in the upcoming Labs with

            <p> Since the previous lab I have learned how to use CSS in order to style my website and change the colors of the background and the text itself. 
                These implementations are done by using keywords such as "color and background-color" in order to change the color of the text and background. 
                I have also learned how to implement a class selector and id selector in which both can either style individually or many. CSS will become integral 
                in my future web development skills. I encountered some syntax issues when trying to use CSS especially with the keywords, but I used the lecture
                 slides and searched on google of implementation of said keywords in order to full understand and manifest the concepts.
