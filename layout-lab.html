            One of the things I learned was the different meanings
            of tags and how to use them properly. I also learned how to properly structure a webpage using HTML and without the tags it
            cant be made. I also learned hot to use VS code and how to use it make a webpage. I also learned how to use github
            and upload my files to it

      <h2>Lab 05 Reflection</h2>
        <p>

        <p><strong>Best Design Practices:</strong>
                 good web designs show a lot when people are looking at your website. 
                 Use a clear layout, font sizes easy to read, and should be able to use them across any platform you 
                 looka them. Navigation should be easy, and color schemes should be easy to read.
