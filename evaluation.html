  <h1>Website Evaluation: Apple.com</h1>

  <h2>What is the URL of the website?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.apple.com</a></p>

  <h2>What is the name of the website?</h2>
  <p>Apple</p>

  <h2>Who is the site's target audience?</h2>
  <p>
    The site is aimed at consumers that want to buy the product, people that are into tech, businesses to sell, 
    and educators interested in Apple products and services.
  </p>

  <h2>How is the site organized?</h2>
  <p>
    Apple.com uses an organized, minimalist top-navigation bar with dropdown menus for their products put in categories 
    which includes (Store, Mac, iPad, iPhone, etc.). The homepage features large visual banners that link to their latest
    products and promotions. The footer contains links to support, legal information, and social media.
  </p>

  <h2>Which CRAP Design Principle does the site use? (Provide at least one example.)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple uses strong visual contrast with white text over dark imagery in banners and bold typography 
    against white backgrounds elsewhere. This helps the people view important information stand out and improves readability. 
    The site also demonstrates <strong>Repetition</strong> by using consistent layouts, typography, and spacing across all pages.
  </p>

  <h2>What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker?</h2>
  <p><strong>Google Lighthouse Accessibility Score:</strong> 89/100</p>
  <p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some elements were missing ARIA labels.</li>
    <li>Certain interactive elements (e.g., carousels) lacked clear keyboard focus states.</li>
    <li>Image alt text was present in most areas but missing in a few decorative icons.</li>
    <li>Text contrast met most WCAG 2.1 AA standards, though some low-opacity text may present issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. The Apple website is well-designed for its purpose and easy to use. It is also very self-explanatory as you can
    get where you need to go.
  </p>

  <h2>What is the site’s efficiency? Can users perform tasks quickly?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. Easy navigation to get to the product you are looking for and it gives you all the information you need like the price 
    and features of the product.
  </p>

  <h2>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?</h2>
  <p>
    Eye-catching as it shows the pictures of the products and the different features on the product. I would say it is appropriate
    especially for a tech company like Apple. As it shows the modern and sleek design that Apple is known for.
  </p>

  <h2>Recommendation(s) to Improve the Website</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enhancing the ARIA labeling as some of the products lack labels which makes it harder to see.</li>
    <li>Improving visibility or contrast in some parts of the website so that it's easier to see.</li>
    <li>Better keyboard navigation can help.</li>
    <li>Consider offering a “skip to main content” link at the top of pages for accessibility.</li>
  </ul>
